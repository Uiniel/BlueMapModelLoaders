## Description
A Minecraft mod that allows [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) to render non-vanilla models that use model loaders provided by forge/neoforge/etc.

- Requires Fabric, Forge or NeoForge
- Requires BlueMap 5.7

## Included model loaders
- obj
- composite
- empty

If I missed any builtin model loader from a popular minecraft mod loader please tell me, and I'll try to implement it. 

## Planned features
