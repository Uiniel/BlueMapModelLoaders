## Description
A Minecraft mod that allows [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) to render non-vanilla models that use model loaders provided by forge/neoforge/etc.

## Installation

### BlueMap >=5.10
Download the [current version](https://github.com/Uiniel/BlueMapModelLoaders/releases/latest) and place the jar file into the packs folder in the BlueMap config directory.

### BlueMap 5.7 - 5.9
Install [version 0.2.2](https://github.com/Uiniel/BlueMapModelLoaders/releases/tag/v0.2.2) as a Forge/Fabric/NeoForge mod.

**Note: Make sure to read this ([#1](https://github.com/Uiniel/BlueMapModelLoaders/issues/1#issuecomment-3109576304)) if you plan to use it on forge 1.20 (only forge is supported for 1.20).**

## Included model loaders
- obj
- composite
- empty

If I missed any builtin model loader from a popular minecraft mod loader please tell me, and I'll try to implement it.
